<p>Thank you for your generous donation to IMBA's Public Lands Initiative. We appreciate your involvement as we build a coalition of supporters to champion bicycle-friendly land protection for our nation's public lands.</p>
<p> While mountain bikers face serious access threats across the country, IMBA has seen recent successes in diverse locations -- including Virginia, Oregon and Colorado -- where mountain bikers have supported measures that allow for bike access while also safeguarding public lands. IMBA's strategies helped mountain bikers gain credibility and clout while enhancing support for the conservation of natural resources. </p>
<p>With your help, IMBA-led efforts in critical states will help us establish a model for negotiating bike access issues across the country. As our resources for this initiative grow we will continue to identify additional opportunities where IMBA can conduct effective grassroots campaigns to keep trails open for mountain biking. </p>
<p>IMBA's Public Lands Initiative offers new resources to promote a bicycle-friendly approach toward our nation's legacy of public lands protection. The strategic elements of the campaign include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Identify high-priority trails across the nation and keep them open to mountain bikes</li>
  <li>Provide professional training sessions, enhanced communication tools and facilitated negotiations with stakeholder groups</li>
  <li>Track management plans and promote pro-bicycle policies at the local, state and federal levels</li>
  <li>Champion public land protection campaigns to protect our trails from development and resource extraction and preserve continued bicycle use</li>
  <li>Build and strengthen multi-user outdoor recreation coalitions</li>
  <li>Unite the bicycle industry, retailers and IMBA clubs behind key land protection campaigns </li>
</ul>
<p>As part of our strategy we have now set up micro-sites for each high priority area.  Please visit our website at IMBA.com/pli for critical updates and information on the Public Lands Initiative. We look forward to keeping you informed of our progress. Thank you again for this exemplary support. </p>
